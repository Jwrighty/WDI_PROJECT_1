# WDI - PROJECT - 1 - Kickback KungFu 

#Intro & Brief
This was my first project on week 3 of the web development immersive course at General Assembly. The brief was to make a game using what HTML, CSS and Javascript we had learnt in the first two weeks of the course. I defined 4 potential game ideas (the others being; a clicker/idle game, connect4 or a piano memory game) and was recommended to tackle the most complex.

#The Game
The idea for the chosen game came from an old Amiga game that i used to play as a child called 'IK+'. Within that there was a mini game where a character in the middle of the screen had to deflect bouncing balls that came in from either side of the screen. The bounce height and movement speed are randomised with the number entering the screen increasing over time. I set out to replicate this, minus the bouncing animations.
